# Football-Events
A football game generates much more events than just statistics from a game. 
It is very important and interesting to take into account the context in which those events were generated. 
Football-Events dataset should keep sports analytics enthusiasts awake for long hours as the number of questions 
that can be asked is huge.
# Aim of the project
Use data science and big data platforms to get more insgight from football events
